## Testing using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org)

Python is a dynamically typed and interpreted language and automated tests
are often a must, in particular for research software.

Please browse [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) and experiment with implementing
and running tests using pytest. When you solve the exercises below, try
to write tests for your code at the same time.


## Exercise suggestions

- Write a tic-tac-toe game
- Design a simple string compression algorithm and write functions to compress and uncompress text
